Files for building COCKPIT LIGHTS panels

There is one panel to the Pilot's left elbow, and another to the First Officer's right elbow. These have control knobs to set
the brightness of various lights in the cockpit.
Probably the steering tiller (just forward of the Pilot's COCKPIT LIGHTS panel) should be wired back to this panel for ease of interfacing.
